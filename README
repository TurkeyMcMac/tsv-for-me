INSTALLATION:
Just run the following command:

make install

to install the binary and the man page. I know this works as-is on Ubuntu, but
on other operating systems it might be necessary to use the following form:

make install bin=<bin path> man=<man path>

SUMMARY:
TSV For Me is a command for aligning Tab-Separated Values[1]. It should not
have any trouble aligning unicode in UTF-8.

USAGE: tsvfm [options] [file]

  -p <padding>    Sets the minimum number of spaces between
                  lines to <padding>. The default is 2.
  -r              Right-align text within the table cells.
  -s <separator>  Sets the character making up the separator
                  line to <separator>. The default is '-'.
  -S              Do not print any separator line.
  -h              Print this help information and exit.
  -v              Print version information and exit.

the 'file' parameter indicates which file to read from. If
left blank, the program reads from standard in.

EXAMPLE:

File "example.tsv":

	Last Name	First Name	Favorite Color
	Smith	Jill	teal
	O'Reilly	Simon	brown
	Miller	Maxwell	extremely pale pink

Output of "tsvfm example.tsv":

	Last Name  First Name  Favorite Color       
	--------------------------------------------
	Smith      Jill        teal                 
	O'Reilly   Simon       brown
